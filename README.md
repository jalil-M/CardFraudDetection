# Credit Card Fraud Detection Kaggle Dataset - Infosys Assignment

An Infosys tech recruiter gave us a challenge : Detect Anomalies or Frauds in ATM or Credit Card Transactions.

The first step was to find a suitable dataset in order to conduct our analysis. In that regard, I prefered to look for kaggle datasets because it is difficult to find ATM Data sets since it contains sensitive data.<br>
Hence, I found the **"Credit Card Fraud Detection"** Dataset, which will be a classification challenge.
In this challenge, It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
