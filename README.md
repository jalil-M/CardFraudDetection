# Credit Card Fraud Detection Kaggle Dataset - Infosys Assignment

This is an assignment done as part of the Technical recruitment at Infosys. 

I was given a challenge : Detect Anomalies or Frauds in ATM or Credit Card Transactions.
The first step was to find a suitable dataset in order to conduct the analysis. In that regard, I preferred to look for kaggle datasets because it is difficult to find ATM Data sets since it contains sensitive data.

Hence, I found the **"Credit Card Fraud Detection"** Dataset, which will be a classification challenge.
In this challenge, It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Thank you in advance for your time !
